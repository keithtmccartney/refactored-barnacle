##Interesting things

* CSS: [will-change](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/will-change) ...used to inform the browser ahead of time that the entire background opacity will change so we can achieve a better rendering performance...

* Angular: [ngOnDestroy - lifestyle hooks](https://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks), [ngOnDestroy - OnDestroy Core API](https://angular.io/api/core/OnDestroy), [ngOnDestroy - Brian Love (Angular + TypeScript Developer in Denver, CO)](https://brianflove.com/2016/12/11/anguar-2-unsubscribe-observables/) ...do not forget also to unsubscribe from each subscription in the ngOnDestroy life cycle hook of the component to avoid memory leaks...
